SafeAndSecure application is an application that helps educate Singaporeans on the current crime trends in Singapore.
Building upon the features available in the SGSecure Application, users are able to:
(1) enroll in a neighbourhood watch program which is an up and coming initiative for Singaporeans to take ownership of the safety of their neighbourhoods
(2) recommend ways to mitigate crime concerns in their neighbourhoods
(3) educate fellow residents with crime prevention tips
